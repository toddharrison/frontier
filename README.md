# Frontier

    Feel free to explore the frontier!

Frontier is a CanaryMod plugin that will delete server anvil data files that are outside of a
specified range on server startup (or on command). This reduces the overall size of your worlds
while still allowing your players to explore as far as they want to their hearts content. After
the server restarts, anything they built or destroyed outside of the civilized area will be
restored automatically to pristine condition.
